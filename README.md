# CyberThreat_NID_Classification_Report

## Abstract 

In this project, we use machine learning alogorithms to understand the intrusion detection on NSL-KDD dataset. Multiple ML algorithms like Random Forest, K-Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier and Ensemble classification are used to understand differnt classes of attacks and their significance in the data set. The accuracy of each models are compared to understand which classification model is more efficient for this dataset. 

## Introduction

In the world where technology is a part of our life or we can even say that we are a part of technology (by looking at the meracles technology is capable of doing today). Safety and privacy of a person is at the utmost importance. It is very easy for a person to leave some data behind every second he is on internet. Tracking this data has become much easier than ever before and in order to prevent, we need to understand the different kinds of attacks that possible on a person or a system.  

IT security is an important issue and much effort has been spent in the research of intrusion and insider threat detection. Many contributions have been published for processing security-related data, detecting botnets, port scans, brute force attacks and so on. All these works have in common that they require representative network-based data sets. There are many benchmark data sets that are good basis to evaluate. I have tried to understand the different class of attacks by analysing the NSL-KDD dataset.

It is very important for a person to understand the different possible attacks in order to prevent himself from being the victim of an attack.


## Goal of the Project

1. The main goal of the project is compare different methods of classification and understand which type is more effective in finding accuracy.   

2. Understanding the classes of attacks and their significance in the data set.

## Knowledge about NSL-KDD

NSL-KDD is a updated version of KDD cup99 data set. NSL-KDD is a data set suggested to solve some of the inherent problems of the KDD'99 data set. This data set is an effective benchmark for researchers to compare different types of Intrusion detection system (IDS) methods, build an Intrusion detection system ( Host based or Network based), doing for some experiments in Cyber security area like wise there is so many advantages. And also there are lot of data sets ( ADFA-ID, ISCX-UNB etc) which use in this field.
